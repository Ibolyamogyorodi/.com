# Frequently Asked Questions

## Simulator features

### Can I install exe files/Windows programs on this?

No. This is just a simulator. It does not have the necessary infrastructure to run those programs.

### Can you add different boot animations for different Windows?

No. Those Windows are just themes designed on the core of Windows 7, they are not meant to have separate boot/welcome screens.

### Can you add different welcome/logon/lock screens for different Windows?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Windows 11 as a theme?

No. Windows 11 is at its very early release, going too far from the boundary may put this simulator at risk due to legal concerns.

### IE and Chrome cannot connect to the internet. Can you fix them?

No. This is as far as I could get to implement them. Please bear with it.

### IE and Chrome are too slow. Can you fix them?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Microsoft Office?

No. Just no.

### Can you add this feature, that feature and more features?

Yes. If the feature is not rejected as above. You can write to me at [visnalize@gmail.com](mailto:visnalize@gmail.com) to help prioritize the requests.

### I don't know the password. How do I login?

You can either click on the suitcase to login with the Guest account, or create your own account and use it to login. For the latter, please see [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/4jra0d0Ufag).

### Can I use this simulator as a launcher?

Yes. With version [2.10.0](./changelog.md#v2-10-0), you can set the simulator as the home screen/launcher, but please keep in mind that this was not really intended as such at the beginning, hence it might not be stable with bugs and issues to be expected.

### Does this simulator work offline?

Yes. However, certain features such as user accounts, some games and browsers will not work as they require internet connection to connect with the servers.

### How do I open the desktop menu?

To open the desktop menu or any context menu, simply hold your finger for a second.

### How do I bring programs/apps to desktop?

There are currently 2 ways:

* From the Start Menu, hold your finger on the programs/apps you want to add, a context menu should appear, then select "Send to Desktop".
* From the desktop, you can refer to [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/gz8dPrHsRCs).

## Miscellaneous

### Can you remove the ads?

No, I'm afraid. I have been spending a lot of my time and effort to develop and maintain this simulator, it even costs me a fair amount of money to maintain the cloud services to retain your user accounts and settings within.

### How can I buy a version without ads?

I'm currently working on this option. You will know when it's available. Thank you for your support.

### Can this simulator work on Android versions earlier than 6.0?

No, I'm afraid. And there is no way to support Android versions older than 6.0 due to certain technical limitations that cannot be resolved.

### Any plan to publish this simulator to App Store?

Not really. It would be nice but the App Store annual fee is pretty high for me, and I doubt it would get passed the review process due to legal concerns.
