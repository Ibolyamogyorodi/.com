## Simulator features

### Can I install exe files/Windows programs on this?

No. This is just a simulator. It does not have the necessary infrastructure to run those programs.

### Can you add different boot animations for different Windows?

No. Those Windows are just themes designed on the core of Windows 7, they are not meant to have separate boot/welcome screens.

### Can you add different welcome/logon/lock screens for different Windows?

No. Please see above.

### IE and Chrome cannot connect to the internet. Can you fix them?

Please keep in mind that this is just a simulator. Web browser functionalities are very limited and are unstable. I'm afraid this is as far I can get to implement them.

No. Please see above.

### IE and Chrome cannot download files/programs. Can you fix them?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Microsoft Office?

### I have forgotten my password. How to recover it?

Unfortunately, your account is gone if you forget the password, there is no way to recover it.

### Can I use this simulator as a launcher/home screen?

No. The launcher/home screen setting was enabled with version [2.10.0](./changelog.md#v2-10-0), however, due to instability, the simulator was then suffered from declined rating with users complaining that it harmed their devices, therefore, this setting is disabled from version [2.11.1](./changelog.md#v2-11-1) onwards.

### Does this simulator work offline?

Yes. However, certain features such as user accounts, some games and browsers will not work as they require internet connection to connect with the servers.

### How do I open the desktop menu?

To open the desktop menu or any context menu, simply hold your finger for a second.

### How do I bring programs/apps to desktop?

There are currently 2 ways:

* From the Start Menu, hold your finger on the programs/apps you want to add, a context menu should appear, then select "Send to Desktop".
* From the desktop, you can refer to [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/gz8dPrHsRCs).

## Miscellaneous

### Can you remove the ads?

No, I'm afraid. I have been spending a lot of my time and effort to develop and maintain this simulator, it even costs me a fair amount of money to maintain the cloud services to retain your user accounts and settings within.

### How can I buy a version without ads?

I'm currently working on this option. You will know when it's available. Thank you for your support.

### Can this simulator work on Android versions earlier than 6.0?

No, I'm afraid. And there is no way to support Android versions older than 6.0 due to certain technical limitations that cannot be resolved.

### Any plan to publish this simulator to App Store?

Not really. It would be nice but the App Store annual fee is pretty high for me, and I doubt it would get passed the review process due to legal concerns.
