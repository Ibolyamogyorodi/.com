# Frequently Asked Questions

## Simulator features

### Can I install exe files/Windows programs on this?

No. This is just a simulator. It does not have the necessary infrastructure to run those programs.

### Can you add different boot animations for different Windows?

No. Those Windows are just themes designed on the core of Windows 7, they are not meant to have separate boot/welcome screens.

### Can you add different welcome/logon/lock screens for different Windows?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Windows 11 as a theme?

No. Windows 11 is at its very early release, going too far from the boundary may put this simulator at risk due to legal issues.

### IE and Chrome cannot connect to the internet. Can you fix them?

No. This is as far as I could get to implement them. Please bear with it.

### IE and Chrome are too slow. Can you fix them?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Microsoft Office?

No. Just no.

### Can you add this feature, that feature and more features?

Yes. If they are not listed above. You can write to me at [visnalize@gmail.com](mailto:visnalize@gmail.com) to help prioritize the requests.

## Miscellaneous

### Can you remove the ads?

I'm afraid not. I have been spending a lot of my time and effort to develop and maintain this simulator, it even costs me a fair amount of money to maintain the cloud services to retain your user accounts and settings within.

### How can I buy a version without ads?

I'm currently working on this option. You will know when it's available. Thank you for your support.
